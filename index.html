                    <li>Kevin Smith is no stranger to being an unapologetic 
                    <em>Star Wars</em>
                    hype-machine, and that trend continues, but in a slightly more specific way than the past. While at Comic-Con, <em>The Jay and Silent Bob Reboot</em> writer and director was asked about his visit to the set of <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>, and Smith spoke non-spoilers, but specifically about the final shot of the film which leads us to believe the very end of the movie may be a bit more than your standard end of <em>Star Wars</em> celebration shot.</li>
                    <li>In an interview with IGN at San Diego Comic-Con, arguably the biggest nerd convention on the planet, it came as no surprise that Kevin Smith, a massive <em>Star Wars</em> fan, would be asked about the upcoming final episode in the Skywalker saga. Now, I am well aware that Smith has been a super hype-guy, especially about <em>Star Wars</em> projects he has been able to visit over the years. It would be shocking to ever hear him say anything disparaging about them to be quite honest. But this was a bit different, as instead of generic hype-words, Smith got specific, and without spoiling anything, revealed that the end of the movie, specifically the final shot, may be a pretty major reveal or surprise.</li>

                    <li>Jon Favreau is having a good summer. The filmmaker’s latest effort, <em>The Lion King</em>, is about to cross the $1 billion mark in just over 10 days, and he has just revealed on Instagram that they are currently scoring his next big project, <em>The Mandalorian</em>. In addition to this, we take a look at what other existing <em>Star Wars</em> content will be joining <em>Star Wars</em>‘ first live action series on Disney+ upon launch this November.</li>
                    <li>Favreau just posted an IG sketch (IG-11 perhaps?) by Dave Filoni on Instagram. The doodle is resting on a soundboard as a way to announce they are scoring the music for <em>The Mandalorian</em>. You can see on the track markers, that French Horns, trumpets, and other brass instruments are in play, which tells us we can expect the typical <em>Star Wars</em> orchestral sounds John Williams paved the way with for over 40 years. <em>The Mandalorian</em> is being composed by Ludwig Göransson (<em>Black Panther</em>).</li>
                    <li><em>The Mandalorian</em> will have company on Disney+ from other existing <em>Star Wars</em> content. The site CNET is reporting that the following <em>Star Wars</em> content will be available on the streaming service upon launch on November 12:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em></li>
                        <li><em>Star Wars: Episodes I – VII</em></li>
                        <li><em>The Clone Wars</em> (Season 7 to arrive within the first year of launch – date TBA)</li>
                        <li><em>Star Wars Rebels</em></li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>This means the only two live action <em>Star Wars</em> movies not on the service at launch will be <em>The Last Jedi</em> and <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em>, simply because those movies are still fulfilling prior contractual commitments to Netflix, and will likely join the service thereafter. It is unclear whether <em>The Clone Wars</em> movie will be on the service or not, as only the series is listed in the report.</li>
                    <li>Disney+ is reported to cost $7/month and will launch on November 12, 2019.</li>

                    <li>It’s a great week for <em>Star Wars</em> bookworms! Timothy Zahn’s final novel in this second Thrawn trilogy – <em>Thrawn: Treason</em> – is finally in the hands of readers. Zahn sat down with Kristin Baver of StarWars.com to talk a little bit about the political intrigue of Treason and his thoughts on writing everyone’s favorite Chiss.</li>

                        <img class="arlicle-image" src="https://www.starwarsnewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/thrawn.jpg">
                    </center>
                    <li>From the sound of it, Orson Krennic will serve as Thrawn’s primary antagonist – though a character like Thrawn tends to view people like Krennic more as opponents or obstacles, and I doubt the the doomed Imperial Director knows who exactly he’s dealing with. Though Darth Sidious is featured on the cover, it sounds like he’ll play his usual role of pulling the strings while unwitting pawns proceed with his plans.</li>
                    <li>From StarWars.com:</li>
                    <li class="quote">“It’s an echo of the Third Reich because Hitler deliberately set his top people fighting among themselves so they wouldn’t gang up on him,” Zahn says. “You can see Palpatine doing very much the same thing, letting Tarkin and Krennic fight back and forth, lest they decide to unite. It’s got a historical basis to it.”</li>
                    <li>Krennic certainly has his menacing moments in <em>Rogue One</em>, but he’d be one of the last people I’d put up against  Grand Admiral Thrawn. It’s an interesting choice by Zahn. We know from the James Luceno novel <em>Catalyst</em> (which served as a prequel to <em>Rogue One</em>) Krennic is deep in the construction of the first Death Star at this point. Thrawn is only serving the Empire at this point in the capacity of reconnaissance for the Chiss Ascendancy and because the Empire is who he’s deemed the ‘winner’ in this part of the galaxy. It’s been hinted that might change once he learns of the Death Star, as the Empire could pose an existential threat to his own people in the Unknown Regions.</li>
                    <li>Eli Vanto is also back, apparently to warn Thrawn of an imminent threat facing the Chiss. You’ll remember Vanto from the first novel in this trilogy, Thrawn, but he was completely absent for the sequel, so fans will no doubt be happy to hear from again. Vanto is the closest thing Thrawn has to a friend in the Empire, so he entrusted the young officer to act as his emissary to the Chiss Ascendency in the Unknown Regions. This will be a great chance to get a glimpse of this part of the galaxy we hear a lot about but know very little of.</li>
                    <li>Though <em>Thrawn: Treason</em> concludes Zahn’s trilogy I think it’s safe to speculate this is not the last we’ll see of the grand admiral. Somewhere in the Unknown Regions, Thrawn and Ezra Bridger just arrived – and there’s no doubt fans would happily line up to hear that story. Timothy Zahn helped launch a new renaissance of <em>Star Wars</em> storytelling in 1991 with Heir to the Empire, so we voracious <em>Star Wars</em> readers certainly owe him a debt of gratitude. Let’s hope this second Thrawn trilogy is not his last. The characters of George Lucas have three trilogies, so I don’t think it’s unreasonable to hope Zahn gets his three as well.</li>
                    <li>Timothy Zahn, speaking to Kristin Baver of StarWars.com:</li>
                    <li class="quote">“The danger with a character that’s been going that long is that the well runs dry. You’re repeating yourself. And the wonderful thing about this latest trilogy is that because it is set in an entirely different era than I’ve ever written in before, I have a whole cast of new characters. I’ve got an entirely different political/military situation, so it’s not the same. It’s the same Thrawn, but he has to deal with entirely different things.”</li>
